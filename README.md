### T BLIND KING (WIP)
- For now I have some issues balancing t character so he wouldnt be available for some time

### BUGS 
 - Removeing curses for c floor when reloading mod (temporary fixed, at least gives curses that BKing have by default(I will think of a way to save all curses when i will be bored of coding "important stuff"))
 
### DEV INFO
<p align="center">
Some of the sprites in this mod (especially portraits) might look bad and thats because it was my first time <br>
making Isaac styled pixelarts I will fix them in "near" future, anyway im still working on this mod but I dont really <br>
have a lot of free time to make a 12h straight coding session like i did when i was starting modding isaac and then <br> 
making this mod (for me its the best way to code effectively otherwise my brain just turn off the moment I stand up <br>
form my PC) but I will try to update this mod at least once a month at least fixing some of the sprites <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Thanks for trying out my mod and good luck
</p>
