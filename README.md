### T BLIND KING (WIP)
- (For now I have some issues balancing t character so he wouldnt be available for some time)

<p align="center">
Some of the sprites in this mod (especially portraits) might look bad and thats because it was my first time <br>
making Isaac styled pixelarts I will fix them in "near" future
</p>

### BUGS 
 - removeing curses for c floor when reloading mod (temporary fixed, at least gives curses that BKing have by default(I will think of a way to save all curses when i will be bored of coding "important stuff"))
